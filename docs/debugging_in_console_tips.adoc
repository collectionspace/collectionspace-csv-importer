== View the CSV data for a batch
This will let you view the data as it is being passed to `collectionspace-mapper`

Look in the URL in the application to see the batch ID (after `batches/`, and before the step id).

In the example below, the batch id = 1, and we are looking at the data from the Preprocess step.

This data will be the same for any step, since it's coming from the original CSV.

[source,ruby]
----
s = Step::Preprocess.find_by(batch: Batch.find(1))
sms = StepManagerService.new(step: s, error_on_warning: false, save_to_file: false)
data = []
sms.process{ |row| data << row }
----

Then, `pp(data)` or use `select` or some other method to isolate only the data rows you want to see.
